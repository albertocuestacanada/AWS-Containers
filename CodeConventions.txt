Resources are named like their type when there is only one, an id will be suffixed with a dash when there are more than one.

Outputs are named like their type, suffixed by "-out"

Parameters are named like their type, suffixed by "-param"

All resources have a link to their documentation page just before the resource delaration.

When an additional source of documentation was required it will be referenced between the documentation link and the resource declaration, with a short explanation of what was it used for.

Short forms will be used for YAML commands (!Ref, !ImportValue, !FindInMap)
